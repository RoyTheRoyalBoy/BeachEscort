During the playtesting session on wednesday, I have recieved numerous feedbacks, in which many believed the concept is original and well thought-out. For example, many people liked the countdown timer mechanic because it adds a sense of urgency to the game in which the player has to think quickly and plan out the obstacles. However, there were also room for improvements and many were directed at the difficulty spike/lack of levels as well as lack of moving enemies. The instructor suggested a moving platform. So in order to incorporate these feedbacks, I revamped the first level to be significantly easier and shorter, added additional levels in which new mechanics were introduced at a time, and then the final level would be an accumulation of all the mechanics. These new mechanics I introduced were scuttling crabs that change directions whenever they bump into anything as well as a moving platform, which resulted in a much deeper game that players can enjoy compared to the earlier prototype.
